			<h1>HISTORY OF SAINT JUDE PARISH SCHOOL</h1>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In the Latte part of 1980's, Trece Martires City, the capital of Cavite Province had several elementary and secondary schools, but no Private Catholic School to call its own. Only few parents caUld afford to send their children to the nearest private catholic school that is twelve kilometers away from the city itself. These parents believe in the values of private catholic education so they clamored for the opening of St. Jude parish School. With this demand, the Parish Priest motivated and brought up a catholic institution. The vision had begun to take form.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
			In 1990, the elusive realization came about through the meticulous hardwork and undying pursuit of the vision. St. Jude Parish School was named after St. Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of the hopeless cases and the patron of city itself. It was the brainchild of Fr. Nonilon B. Tibayan, the Parish Priest of St. Jude Thaddeus Parish Church.

		<p>
			The project did not come as a boon on a platter. It get tough especially at the start. The classroom then was made of pawid and othe scrap materials. Mrs. Aide P. Ilagan and Mrs. Bessie C. Mondragon were the prime movers of the school handling kindergarten classes with two four-year old and thirty six five-year old pupils enrolled.
